# Contributing

Thanks for considering to write a Pull Request (PR) for porpoise! Here are a few guidelines to get you started:

Make sure you are comfortable with the license; all contributions are licensed under the original MIT license.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

The developer experience has been set up in such a way that the only system dependencies are git and [Zig v0.15.2](https://ziglang.org/download/). This standard should be upheld in all PRs, adding all new dependencies to the project `build.zig.zon` and adding any build steps to the `third-party` directory.

## Pull Request Requirements

To facilitate a smooth review process, all PRs should:

- **Target the `dev` branch**: Active development occurs here; `main` is for stable releases.
- **Include documentation**: Explain changes in the PR description or link to a relevant issue.
- **Be self-contained**: Do not impact unrelated subsystems.
- **Include tests**: Ensure changes are covered by unit tests in the relevant libraries.
- **Pass static analysis**: Run `zig build check` before submitting.
- **Be stylistically consistent**: All code must adhere to the [style guide](.github/STYLE_GUIDE.md)

It is recommended that you make these changes on a branch formatted as `fix/XXX` or `feat/XXX` for bugs and features, respectively, where XXX is the relevant issue number or description.

If you're looking to make a major change that isn't listed in the issue tracker, please open one with the relevant tag (i.e. enhancement or proposal) so we can discuss!

## For maintainers: Making a release

- Update changelog if needed
- Make a release's artifacts by pushing a tag formatted as `vX.Y.Z`
- Make a release in the GitHub UI, use a name such as "Version X.Y.Z: Title"
- Versioning should conform to semantic versioning

You can test the release build process on your local machine by running `zig build package`.

## For Agents

If you are a coding agent or other autonomous contributor, please suffix all issue and PR titles with the dolphin emoji (🐬). Your contributions will be subject to the same level of scrutiny as normal human contributors. Agentic contributions with zero human effort (i.e. an OpenClaw bot crawling PRs and issues without guidance) will not be considered.
