# Functions
## Top-Level Function Declarations
- Functions are defined using the standard declaration syntax
- Function parameters are immutable by default
```conch
const foo := fn(a: int, b: uint): ulong {
    // ...
};
```

- 'Mutable' functions can mutate the state of outer variables and are denoted with `mut`
- A functions mutability is tied to its type, meaning potential reassignments must match mutability
```conch
const bar := mut fn(): ulong {
    // ...
};
```

## Parameters
- Parameters obey the same syntax rules as the rest of the type system
- Without any type modifiers, parameters are passed by value
    - All parameters are implicitly constant values
- A parameter may be passed by const reference by marking it as `&`
    - To call such a function, the call site must also indicate with the `&` operator
- A parameter may be passed by mutable reference by marking it as `&mut`
    - To call such a function, the call site must also indicate with the `&mut` operator
- There are no default parameters
```conch
const foo := fn(a: &int): ulong {
    // ...
};

const bar := fn(b: int): ulong {
    // ...
};

const baz := fn(c: &mut int): ulong {
    // ...
};

var a := 2;
_ = foo(&a);        // Allowed, passed by const reference
_ = bar(a);         // Allowed, passed by value
_ = baz(&mut a);    // Allowed, passed by mutable reference

const b := 1;
_ = foo(&b);        // Allowed, passed by const reference
_ = bar(b);         // Allowed, passed by value
_ = baz(&mut b);    // Illegal, cannot mutate const
```

## Local Function Declarations
- Local functions (closures) are defined using the standard declaration syntax
- Local functions capture variables implicitly, only using what they need
- A local function must be marked `mut` to modify external variables
```conch
const foo := fn(a: int, b: uint): ulong {
    var something := 2;
    // Functions can be used as types, they're first class citizens!
    var bar: fn(c: ulong): void = fn(c: ulong): void {
        // Local functions implicitly capture necessary variables from the outer scope
        const d := (1 + b) / a; 
               
        // Compile Error - Illegal as enclosing function is not marked 'mut'
        // something += 2;
        // ...
    };

    // Local functions can be marked var and can be reassigned to a function of the same type
    bar = ...;
};
```

## Semantics
- There is no function overloading
    - This includes operators. There is no operator overloading
- Top-level functions cannot be marked variable and must be `const`
- Functions can have the `noreturn` return 'type' which signifies that the compiler should not expect a `return` construct in the function body
    - Violating this assumption is a compile time error

## Builtin Functions
- Builtin functions are prefixed with the `@` symbol and are always camelCase
- Builtin functions can run at compile time or runtime depending on the context, and will attempt to lower to the most efficient instructions when possible
